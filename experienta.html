    technology used: Java Spring Framework, JPA, React.js and MySQL
    Project: A a web application based on a Peer-to-Peer car rental
    marketplace system, having a complete rental system where users can
    add an ad for a new car or rent one from an existing list. They can
    fill in information about their car, upload and view photos and the
    car infos on the car details page, filter the list of ads using keywords
    such as the car model or the city where the car is located.
    They can also set the period for which the car is available and will
    receive a confirmation email after the car has been rented. The app is
    secured using Spring Security with JWT and has a control system for
    the ads, the users being able to remove the ad from the list or return
    the car at any time.
